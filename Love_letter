I love the C language, 
they say it's an old language.  
Well I have always loved old ladies. 
The experienced, the ones that built the world that we live in. 

They really do understand the hardware of life. 

Low level view of how things work. 
You might say that is just tradition. 
And you are you right, but I need to remember tradition to 
invent a new path. 

A new Language, a new way of seeing the horizont, 
new view on computational magic. 

From Python, to TypeScript. 
From Kotlin to C++. 
From C to assembly language. 
From Hexadecimal to the Binary bits. 
From the logic gates to the electrons 
flowing freely from semi conductor to another, 
Solely bound by usefulness to the human mind. 

Unless those semi conductors are running TikTok.
